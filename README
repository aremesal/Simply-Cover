Motivation

So many companies, especially small bussiness or local shops, are arriving to Internet. Many of them reserve a domain name but they
spend a lot of time for publishing their website, or even reserve the domain name just to have an email under their own domain, but
they aren't planning to publish a website. But public, knowing existence of the domain, will try to enter their web, finding the
topical "Under construction" or even worse, a blank website or a message from service provider.

Simply Cover offers a very easy ans simple content management system, but can offer a fully functional web cover showing a good
image in the meantime the actual website is published; if the company isn't going to publish a website, Simply Cover offers a 
simple website showing company contact data, a contact form... so the visitant doesn't take a deception.

Description

Simply Cover is a web application written in PHP, aimed to be very lightweight in order to use it in small hostings, like 
cheaper hostings or just-email-plans are, which doesn't support a more complicated web.

So, Simply Cover weights under 2MB, and doesn't need a database; it can be installed on any hosting plan with just a few Megabytes
of space and PHP5.3 support. It's all.

The easy content manager allows you to configure title and subtitle for the company, and its logo. You can write a free description
about your company, services, strong points, opening hours... You can attach as many images as you want, which will be shown using
a pretty carrousel. The visitant can contact you through the provided contact form and a localization map.

Instalation

You can downlad source code from https://github.com/aremesal/Simply-Cover, or clone the project using Git:

$ git clone git@github.com:aremesal/Simply-Cover.git

Requirements:

- Web hosting with at least 2MB of spare space
- PHP5.3 and GD library support

Steps to install:
- Download and uncompress the code or clone the proyect, and put it in a directory accessable from the web (by example, /public_html/
in a shared hosting service).
- Point your domain to /public directory.
- Edit file /config/conf.php and set USELANG param (up in the file) to your desire language.
- Check that files /data/web.yaml, /public/css/custom.css and directories /view/compiled and /public/images/uploads 
can be written by web server.
- Go to the web. First time you'll see an advice pointing you to change default administrator password.
To do this, enter the administration (http://example.com/Admin) with default user credentials:
User: email@example.com
Password: simplycoveradmin
- In the administration area, you can configure all params, write texts and upload images.
- First of all, you must set the Google Maps API Key (http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html)
 
Setting up a new language

To configure a new language, create a new file with the language code into /lang directory, by example, to french language
create /lang/fr.php.

Copy content from another language file into the new archive, and change each string to the desired translation. The first
line of the file must include default language (include_once '../lang/en.php';) as you can see in other language files
like in the spanish one (es.php).

Once you've created the new language, set USELANG param in /config/conf.php.
